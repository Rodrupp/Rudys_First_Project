x <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10)
sum(x)
mean(x)
unique(x)  ## eliminates duplicates
summary(x)
median(x)
floor(x)
sd(x)  ## standard deviation
sqrt(x) ## square root
abs(x) ## absolute value
Inf  ## infinity, also possible in the negative
NaN  ## Not a number, such as 0/0



quantile(x, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))  ## quartiles, percentiles, deciles...

signif(x) ## rounds to significant figures

rep(2, 4)  ## repeats a number, n amount of times
gl(3, 10)  ## generates a numeric vector, elements are 1 repeated k times,
                ## then 2 repeated k times, then 3, until the number is equal 
                ## to n. 
rnorm(10, 5, 2.1)  
  ## generates n random numbers with mean and standard dev, based on a 
  ## normal distribution.
runif(10, 3, 13) 
  ## generates n random numbers, with minimum and max set, based on a
  ## uniform distribution.

corr(x, runif(length(x), 0, 10))  ## calculates correlation between to vectors
