# Swirl commands  
 - `library(swirl)` to load the package.  
 - `install_from_swirl("course name")` to download a course.  
 - `swirl()` to start swirl.  

## When you are at the R prompt (>):  
 - Typing `skip()` allows you to skip the current question.  
 - Typing `play()` lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...  
  -- UNTIL you type `nxt()` which will regain swirl's attention.  
 - Typing `bye()` causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.  
 - Typing `main()` returns you to swirl's main menu.  
 - Typing `info()` displays these options again.
